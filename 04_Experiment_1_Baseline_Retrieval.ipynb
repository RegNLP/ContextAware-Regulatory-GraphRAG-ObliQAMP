        "The results from the initial baseline experiment provide several clear and important insights into the effectiveness of different retrieval strategies for your dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Observation 1: Hybrid Retrieval is a Clear Winner**\n",
        "In every single test case, the Hybrid method (combining dense semantic search with lexical BM25) significantly outperformed both the Dense (semantic only) and the Lexical Only (BM25) methods. This holds true across all metrics, including nDCG@10, Recall, and MAP. This strongly indicates that for your specific regulatory documents, combining keyword relevance with semantic meaning is the most effective initial retrieval strategy.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Observation 2: e5-large is the Superior Embedding Model**\n",
        "Across all context strategies and retrieval methods, the e5-large model consistently produced better results than the mpnet model. This suggests that e5-large has a better grasp of the nuances of your legal and regulatory text, leading to better recall and overall ranking quality.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Observation 3: Graph Context is Beneficial (with a Trade-off)**\n",
        "When evaluating the top-performing e5-large model across all three key metrics, a clear picture emerges:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Best Overall Ranking Quality (nDCG@10 & MAP@10): The parent_child context achieved the highest scores for both nDCG@10 (0.3950) and MAP@10 (0.3069). Since both of these metrics heavily reward placing correct documents at the very top of the ranked list, this configuration is the most precise.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Best for Finding Documents (Recall@10): The full_neighborhood context achieved the highest recall (0.4163). This indicates it was the most effective at finding all relevant passages and placing them somewhere within the top 10 results, even if not perfectly ordered.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Conclusion:** Identifying the Champion and Runner-Up\n",
        "Based on a balanced view of all three metrics, we can identify a clear champion for the next stage of experiments.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Champion Retriever: e5-large model with parent_child context, using the Hybrid method. It is the winner on two of the three most important metrics (nDCG@10 and MAP@10), making it the best-performing retriever for delivering highly relevant results at the top of the list.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Strong Runner-Up: e5-large model with full_neighborhood context, using the Hybrid method. While its ranking precision is a fraction lower, it excels at recall, making it an excellent and very close alternative.\n",
        "\n",
        "Since the performance of these two is extremely close, they both represent excellent starting points for our more advanced re-ranking experiments."

The simple, additive graph bonuses (parent, citation, etc.) were not nuanced enough to improve upon this strong baseline and, in some cases, likely introduced noise that harmed the ranking.\n",
        "\n",
